Getting Started!
After cloning, make sure to use flutter pub get on the terminal to get started.
Main Challenges we faced building the app
A few Git/merge conflicts in the first 2 sprints due to flutter having thousands of cache files. We were able to mitigate these issues relatively fast after the first occurrence.
Making firebase realtime database store user specific data. I was able to resolve it by changing rules in the realtime database.
Storing notification information in the realtime database for specific users. I was able to eventually resolve it after being able to store user specific information inside of realtime database.
Lessons we learned
Practical use of Agile methodologies
Ability to collaborate with other developers to complete user stories.
There’s always something new to add or to improve, therefore managing time to only focus on the important parts of the app and make them better.
Software engineers work in teams, so we learned that communication is very important.
Always be open to learn and help out others.
There's always more than one way to do something.
We also learned when to stop.
Challenge our norms and be open to change.
